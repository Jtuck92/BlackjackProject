# Blackjack Project

## Overview
This program was written as a Week-4 homework assignment for Skill Distillery. Its function is to simulate a back-alley Blackjack dealer. The user assumes the role of the Player and is dealt cards as per the rules of Blackjack. Follwing the options laid out by the console will result in victory or defeat. 

## Topics
* Object-Oriented Programming
* Packages
* Abstraction
* Polymorphism
* Inheritance
* Encapsulation
* Array Lists
* Exception Handling
* Enums
* Game Theory

## How To Run
* The user is immediately presented the menu which contains the option to either engage with the back-alley Dealer, or cut their losses and shamble back into the night.
* The user, in the role of the player, is dealt two cards. 
* The user may choose to 'Hit' or 'Stay'.
* This process continues until a winner is decided, and the program re-prompts the user with the root menu.

## Lessons Learned
This was another titanic project, dwarfing the even the assignment from Week 3. The ordered minimum viable product took less time to fully implement and test, however. It is the opinon of the programmer that he may be improving... The biggest lessons taken from this excercise were, again, how to organize a program that consists of several different functions and processes, as well as how to manage the time and energy of the programmer effectivley. The added functionality of the Enum concept proved
a challenge to properly utilize.
